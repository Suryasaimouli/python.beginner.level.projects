# 🔐 Easy Password Generator

This script generates a simple password using:
- Letters  
- Symbols  
- Numbers  

The characters are added in a **fixed order**:
Letters → Symbols → Numbers.

This makes it easier but less secure than fully random passwords.

---

## 🚀 How It Works
The program asks:
- How many **letters** you want
- How many **symbols**
- How many **numbers**

Then it combines them into a single password.

# 🔥 Hard Password Generator (Secure)

This script generates a **strong and fully randomized password** using:
- Letters  
- Symbols  
- Numbers  

It stores selected characters in a list, then **shuffles** them using `random.shuffle()` to ensure complete randomness.

## 🚀 Why It’s More Secure
Unlike the easy version:
- Characters are added in random order  
- Harder to guess  
- Suitable for strong security purposes  

---

## 🧠 How It Works
1. User chooses the number of letters, symbols, and numbers.  
2. Characters are added into a list.  
3. The list is shuffled.  
4. Final password is created from the randomized sequence.
